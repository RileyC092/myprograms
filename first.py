# First actual program.
# variables cannot be started with a number, they are often started with a lowercase letter. 
# variables are dynamic and can be updated 
# Datatype of variable doesn't need to be specified. 
# Python doesn't need an ending like a semicolon.
# the equals sign represents the assignment operator (variable on the left and value on the right)
# right side of equal sign is the value of the data
# int = integer 
# float = +/- decimal 
# bool = True or False
# str = String, alpha, numeric, special symbols 
# list = datatype which can hold many other data types
# dict = dictionary 
# input is an example of a built in function
# the input function stores the string input from the terminal to the related variable 
# end is a built in function for strings to end them without a space, end is assumed as \n (new line)
# sep is what seperates the two strings, sep is assumed as space

# message = "Hello, welcome to ICS4U"  
# name = input("What is your name?: ")
# print(message, name, end=" ", sep=" ")
# print("HELLO BUDDY")

#if we add two ints then it literally adds them
# command + / makes everything comments

# num1 = 2
# num2 = 1
# print(num1 + num2)

#input function reads everything as a string 

num1 = int(input("Enter num1: "))
num2 = int(input("Enter num2: "))
print(num1 + num2)

# int() is a composite of both so in this case it takes the strings and converts them to integers which is why we get 3 now instead of 21

# git add (name)
# git commit -m "some message"
# git push
